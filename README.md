# BlackJackGame
This is a very simple black jack game. 
It is played entirely through the commandline and does unfortunately not have any GUI. 
It is absolutly flawed in terms of efficiency and accuracy towards the actual game of black jack, but it was just a fun little project I made when I was bored.
